I am Vishnuraddi Y. Koppad, currently pursuing my 8th semester in Computer Science and Engineering at STJ Institute of Technology, Ranebennur – 581115. 
I have good knowledge of C, Java, Python, and JavaScript. I have worked on projects such as Vehicle Price Prediction and E-commerce Telegram Bot.

Currently, I'm working as web devoloper Intern at Thincnext at Bengaluru.
As an intern, I aim to gain hands-on experience in developing end-to-end web applications using Java, Spring Boot, and modern frontend technologies, 
while strengthening my understanding of RESTful APIs, database integration, and secure authentication mechanisms.
I also seek to enhance my knowledge of full stack architecture, version control systems, and real-world software development practices. 
Through this internship, I intend to improve my problem-solving abilities, teamwork skills, and my capability to build scalable and maintainable applications.
